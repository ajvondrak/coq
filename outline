What's Coq?
`trivial.` = `auto 1.`

---

auto n =
  if n == 0
    failure
  try assumption.
  for tautology in hypotheses U hints:
    try apply tautology. (* including `apply eq_refl.` == `reflexivity.` *)
    (* produces subgoals *)
    for each subgoal:
      call `auto (n - 1)` on subgoal
    if all subgoals are solved
      success

---

assumption =
  tries to match the current goal exactly against all current hypotheses

---

apply term =
  tries to match the current goal against the conclusion of the type of term
  Success: returns subgoals = non-dependent premises of term's type
  The tactic apply relies on first-order unification with dependent types

Then, we find equality, defined as an inductive relation. That is, given a type
A and an x of type A, the predicate (eq A x) is the smallest one which contains
x. This definition, due to Christine Paulin-Mohring, is equivalent to define eq
as the smallest reflexive relation, and it is also equivalent to Leibniz’
equality.

Coq < Inductive eq (A:Type) (x:A) : A -> Prop :=
Coq <     eq_refl : eq A x x.

(* The following doesn't work, because you're required to use y: *)

Coq < Inductive eq (A:Type) (x:A) (y:A) : Prop :=
Coq <     eq_refl : eq A x x.

DETAILS:

As a running example for the first part of the chapter, let's consider a simple
property of natural numbers, and let's say that the numbers possessing this
property are "beautiful." Informally, a number is beautiful if it is 0, 3, 5,
or the sum of two beautiful numbers. More pedantically, we can define beautiful
numbers by giving four rules:

  Rule b_0: The number 0 is beautiful.
  Rule b_3: The number 3 is beautiful.
  Rule b_5: The number 5 is beautiful.
  Rule b_sum: If n and m are both beautiful, then so is their sum.

In Coq, we can express the definition of beautiful as follows:

  Inductive beautiful : nat → Prop :=
    b_0 : beautiful 0
  | b_3 : beautiful 3
  | b_5 : beautiful 5
  | b_sum : ∀n m, beautiful n → beautiful m → beautiful (n+m).

Look again at the formal definition of the beautiful property. The opening
keyword, Inductive, has been used up to this point to declare new types of
data, such as numbers and lists. Does this interpretation also make sense for
the Inductive definition of beautiful? That is, can we view evidence of beauty
as some kind of data structure? Yes, we can!

The trick is to introduce an alternative pronunciation of ":". Instead of "has
type," we can also say "is a proof of." For example, the second line in the
definition of beautiful declares that b_0 : beautiful 0. Instead of "b_0 has
type beautiful 0," we can say that "b_0 is a proof of beautiful 0." Similarly
for b_3 and b_5.

eq x y, or simply x=y expresses the equality of x and y. Both x and y must
belong to the same type A. The definition is inductive and states the
reflexivity of the equality. The others properties (symmetry, transitivity,
replacement of equals by equals) are proved below. The type of x and y can be
made explicit using the notation x = y :> A. This is Leibniz equality as it
expresses that x and y are equal iff every property on A which is true of x is
also true of y

  Inductive eq (A:Type) (x:A) : A -> Prop :=
      eq_refl : x = x :>A

  where "x = y :> A" := (@eq A x y) : type_scope.

  Notation "x = y" := (x = y :>_) : type_scope.

  (* Wonky-looking stuff that says to infer the argument A. *)

  Arguments eq {A} x _.
  Arguments eq_refl {A x} , [A] x.

[The @-sign has to do with making implicit arguments explicit for a particular
function application.]

How the hell does that help?

Inductive nat : Set :=
  | O : nat
  | S : nat -> nat.

The clauses of this definition can be read:
    * O is a natural number (note that this is the letter "O," not the numeral
      "0").
    * S is a "constructor" that takes a natural number and yields another one —
      that is, if n is a natural number, then S n is too.

Let's look at this in a little more detail.  Every inductively defined set
(weekday, nat, bool, etc.) is actually a set of expressions. The definition of
nat says how expressions in the set nat can be constructed:
    * the expression O belongs to the set nat;
    * if n is an expression belonging to the set nat, then S n is also an
      expression belonging to the set nat; and
    * expressions formed in these two ways are the only ones belonging to the
      set nat.

These three conditions are the precise force of the Inductive declaration. They
imply that the expression O, the expression S O, the expression S (S O), the
expression S (S (S O)), and so on all belong to the set nat, while other
expressions like true, andb true false, and S (S false) do not.

Calculus of Inductive Constructions < Calculus of Constructions (CoC ~> Coq)
http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs430/coq/doc/Reference-Manual006.html

beta-reduction.
We want to be able to identify some terms as we can identify the application of
a function to a given argument with its result. For instance the identity
function over a given type T can be written lambda x:T, x. In any environment E
and context Gamma, we want to identify any object a (of type T) with the
application ((lambda x:T, x) a). We define for this a reduction (or a
conversion) rule we call beta:
  E[Gamma] |- ((lambda x:T, t) u) |>beta t{x/u}
We say that t{x/u} is the beta-contraction of ((lambda x:T, t) u) and,
conversely, that ((lambda x:T, t) u) is the beta-expansion of t{x/u}.

According to beta-reduction, terms of the Calculus of Inductive Constructions
enjoy some fundamental properties such as confluence, strong normalization,
subject reduction. These results are theoretically of great importance but we
will not detail them here and refer the interested reader to [21].

iota-reduction.
A specific conversion rule is associated to the inductive objects in the
environment. We shall give later on (section 4.5.4) the precise rules but it
just says that a destructor applied to an object built from a constructor
behaves as expected. This reduction is called iota-reduction and is more
precisely studied in [103, 117].

delta-reduction.
We may have defined variables in contexts or constants in the global
environment. It is legal to identify such a reference with its value, that is
to expand (or unfold) it into its value. This reduction is called
delta-reduction and shows as follows.
  E[Gamma] |- x |>delta t     if (x:=t:T)inGamma         E[Gamma] |- c |>delta t     if (c:=t:T)in E

zeta-reduction.
Coq allows also to remove local definitions occurring in terms by replacing the
defined variable by its value. The declaration being destroyed, this reduction
differs from delta-reduction. It is called zeta-reduction and shows as follows.
  E[Gamma] |- let x:=u in t |>zeta t{x/u}
